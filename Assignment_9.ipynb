        "\n",
        "Training neural networks with imbalanced datasets can pose several challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Biased Learning: Neural networks can be biased towards the majority class when trained on imbalanced datasets. The network may prioritize accuracy on the majority class while neglecting the minority class, resulting in poor performance on the minority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Limited Samples: The scarcity of samples from the minority class can lead to overfitting on the available data. The network may struggle to generalize well to unseen minority class instances, affecting its ability to detect or classify them accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Evaluation Metrics: Traditional evaluation metrics like accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced datasets. Accuracy can be high if the model predicts the majority class correctly but performs poorly on the minority class. Metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) are more suitable for evaluating performance in imbalanced datasets.\n",

        "- Sampling Techniques: Imbalanced datasets can benefit from various sampling techniques. Oversampling the minority class by replicating samples or generating synthetic samples (e.g., using SMOTE) can help alleviate the class imbalance. Undersampling the majority class can also be employed, but it runs the risk of discarding valuable information.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Class Weights: Assigning class weights during training can help balance the influence of different classes. Higher weights can be assigned to the minority class to give it more importance during training, helping the network focus on learning its patterns.\n",

        "Adversarial attacks are deliberate attempts to deceive or manipulate neural networks by introducing carefully crafted perturbations to input data. These perturbations are often imperceptible to humans but can cause the network to make incorrect predictions or classifications. Adversarial attacks exploit the vulnerabilities of neural networks and can have serious consequences in security-sensitive applications.\n",

By exposing the network to adversarial examples during training, it can better generalize and make more accurate predictions on both clean and adversarial inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Defensive Distillation: Defensive distillation is a technique where the network is trained on softened probabilities rather than the hard predictions. This introduces more uncertainty in the network's predictions and makes it harder for adversaries to generate effective adversarial examples.\n",
